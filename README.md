# AI-Human-Text-Classifier

## Overview
This project uses machine learning models to classify text as written by a human or AI. The models explored: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Features were extracted using TF-IDF and Word2Vec.

## Data
[Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shanegerami/ai-vs-human-text/data)

## Files

- `ai_human_text_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used for data exploration, feature extraction, model training/evaluation, and conclusions.
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment file for setting up the required environment.

## Results
Logistic Regression with TF-IDF is the best model for this classification task.
